      <p>
        I set the linear regression model up to predict touchdowns(my dependent
        variable) based of the total yards(my independent variable). The
        equation for my linear model is : y = -0.0518 + 0.0078x The model proved
        to be good but there is room for improvement. The residuals show a
        normal distribution. My takeaway from the linear model was that more
        touchdowns does not always mean more yardage. With a majority of the
        players that scored between 3 and 5 touchdowns running under 500 yards,
        most of them were placed in goal line situation.
