      <h1>Outliers and Multi-Variable Analysis</h1>

      <h2>Top 10 Age 30+ Rushing Leaders</h2>
      <p>
        I take a closer look at the over 30 years of age players and examine the
        top 10. We can see running back Adrian Peterson of the Washington
        Redskins at age 33 ran for over 1000 yards and scored 7 touchdowns was
        the best ranked rusher over 30 in addition to being ranked 4th overall.
        Also notable is quarterback Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks at
        age 30 averaging 5.6 yards per attempt as one of the only 2 quarterbacks
        in the top 10 over 30 years old.

      <h2>Touchdowns and Total Yards</h2>
      <p>
        We can see a linear relationship here between these two variables. It
        makes sense that if a player is running more, it is more likely that
        they will score more.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Yards Per Attempt and Total Yards</h2>
      <p>
        Comparing the average yards per attempt with the total yards does not
        tell the whole story. The players with more yards per attempt did not
        exactly mean they ran for more yards in total.
