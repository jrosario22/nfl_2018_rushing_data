      <h2>Predicted Yards vs Actual Yards</h2>
      <p>
        Running the same training/testing data as above to predict total yards
        with a k-nearest neighbor regressor of max depth of 3 as well produced a
        different look. I got a Mean Square Error of 2825.61 and the model
        appears to over estimate the shorter yardages more than the decision
        tree regressor.
